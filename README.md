Fraud Detection using Machine Learning 💳🔍
This project is a fraud detection model built as part of an internship assignment. It identifies fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques on imbalanced data.

Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

Jupyter Notebook

Problem Statement
Given a dataset of transactions, build a model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions (isFraud = 1) while dealing with significant class imbalance.

Steps Followed
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Checked for missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Data Balancing

Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to handle imbalanced classes

Model Training

Used XGBoost classifier

Trained on a balanced subset for efficiency

Evaluation

Evaluated using confusion matrix & classification report

Achieved high precision and recall for the fraud class

Outcome
✅ Model trained successfully
✅ Achieved good performance on identifying rare fraudulent transactions
✅ Project submitted as part of internship task



Note:

🔗 Dataset is not shared publicly due to internship guidelines

📁 The final Jupyter Notebook is available in this repository
